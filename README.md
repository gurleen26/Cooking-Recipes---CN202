PROBLEM STATEMENT:-Your task is to develop a web-based platform that serves as a hub for recipe sharing, enabling users to discover, save, and 
share recipes while fostering a community of passionate home cooks and food lovers.
Cooking enthusiasts often face challenges in discovering new recipes, organizing their culinary creations, and sharing their favorite dishes with others. 
Additionally, novice cooks may struggle to find reliable recipes tailored to their skill level and dietary preferences.

how to cook and all the ingredients. For example tabletalk contains further sections as tea, coffee, lemonade, etc.Each recipie section 
will also signify the history and the origin of that particular recipie. Our website provides the desired recipe for the user.
